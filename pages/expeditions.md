# CoEvolve Expeditions

Within the CoEvolve project we will visit a number of exciting extreme environments with diverse geological, geochemical and microbiological characteristics. The aim is to collect data from diverse ecosystems influenced in different ways by plate tectonics. Different tectonic settings provide different metals to the microorganisms living in the area. Our sampling approach collects samples across large spatial scales (hundreds of kilometers), to couple the microbiological data with large-scale variations in the geology and geochemistry. These expeditions typically have a team of 10-15 scientists with diverse backgrounds and expertise. The map below shows both the ERC CoEvolve field sites (in blue) and the partner field sites (in orange) accessed leveraging collaborations with other projects.
