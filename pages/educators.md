With the ERC CoEvolve project our aims are not only scientific, but educational too! One of our objective is to bring concept related to life and Planet coevolution, the importance of environmental microbes and the key role of metals for Life in the classroom at all educational level. For this, we are preparing a number of resources that can be used by teachers and instructors at all level of education to bring some science and excitement for fieldwork to their students.

We also regularly do meeting and online seminars with classrooms from everywhere, often directly from the filed. Below you'll find a list of activities we have already organized. Get in touch with us if you want someone from the ERC CoEvolve project team to visit your school or you'd like to connect with us live while we are in the field!

Also, see below material designed for [Primary Schools](#primary-schools), [Secondary Schools](#secondary-schools), [High Schools](#high-schools) and [Undergraduate Curricula](#Undergraduate-curricula) both in STEM and beyond.
